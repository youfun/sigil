defmodule Sigil.Security.ShellPathGuard.Test do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for shell command path extraction.

  Reference: `cortex/tools/shell_path_guard.ex` (Cortex ShellPathGuard)
  Test pattern: hand-written from Cortex ShellPathGuard behavior

  Known gaps (tests prefixed `ideal_`):
    - Current extract_paths/1 splits only on shell metacharacters (;&|...),
      NOT on spaces. So "ls /etc/hosts" returns ["ls /etc/hosts"], not ["/etc/hosts"].
    - Full path extraction from space-separated arguments is a documented gap.

  Covers:
    - Current behavior: shell metacharacter splitting, comment exclusion, dedup
    - Expected (ideal) behavior: space-separated path extraction, ~ expansion
