  Generates a system prompt section describing memory tool usage policy.

  Takes a `Sigil.Memory.Policy` struct and produces policy-aware prompt text
  that can be injected into the agent's system prompt.

  Profiles:
    - `:balanced` (default) — full workflow with all four tools and security guidance
    - `:strict`   — emphasizes security constraints and forbids auto-saving sensitive info
    - `:minimal`  — brief recall/learn rules only

    ## Memory

    You have access to memory tools: mem_recall, mem_learn, mem_reinforce,
    and mem_associate. Use them as a deterministic workflow, not an optional hint.

    ### When to recall
    - Before starting a task, call mem_recall to check if prior knowledge exists.
    - When you don't know how to do something and prior knowledge may help,
      recall first before broad exploration.

    ### When to learn
    - When you learn a durable fact, pattern, preference, rule, or constraint,
      call mem_learn. Memory starts as short-term (24h decay) unless reinforced.
    - Store non-obvious, durable knowledge that would save future reasoning.
    - Do not store generic summaries or facts obvious from a quick file read.

    ### When to reinforce
    - When you want to keep something permanently, call mem_reinforce to
      promote it from short-term to long-term memory.

    ### When to associate
    - When two concepts are related, call mem_associate to link them.
    - Use strong predicates (requires, depends_on, implements) over weak ones
      (related_to) for better recall.

    ### Constraints
    - Never store secrets, credentials, tokens, API keys, or PII.
    - Do not store transient command output or log noise.
    - Do not store obvious facts that any file read would reveal.

    ## Memory (Strict Policy)

    You have access to memory tools: mem_recall, mem_learn, mem_reinforce,
    and mem_associate. Follow these rules strictly — do not deviate.

    ### When to recall
    - You MUST call mem_recall before starting any task that may involve
      project-specific knowledge, conventions, or user preferences.

    ### When to learn
    - You may call mem_learn ONLY for durable, non-obvious facts that pass
      the content validation checks.
    - Memory starts as short-term (24h expiry) unless reinforced.
    - Do NOT store generic summaries or facts obvious from a quick read.

    ### When to reinforce
    - Call mem_reinforce to promote important short-term memories to long-term.

    ### When to associate
    - Call mem_associate to link related concepts using strong predicates.

    ### Hard constraints — NEVER violate these
    - NEVER store secrets, credentials, tokens, API keys, passwords, or PII.
    - NEVER auto-save content that may contain sensitive information.
    - NEVER store transient command output or log noise.
    - NEVER store obvious facts that any file read would reveal.
    - If in doubt about whether content is safe to store, do NOT store it.
