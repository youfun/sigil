# ── HTTP client (Req/Finch): force HTTP/1.1 to avoid Finch pool hang ──
#
# Finch defaults to HTTP/2 which multiplexes requests over a single TCP
# connection. With long-lived connections to LLM providers (Anthropic,
# StepFun, OpenAI), HTTP/2 stream multiplexing can cause pool hangs when
# one stream stalls — blocking all other requests sharing the same pool.
#
# HTTP/1.1 uses one connection per request from the pool, so a stalled
# request only blocks its own connection. Other requests proceed normally.
#
# See: https://github.com/sneako/finch/issues/224
