# .credo.exs — Credo config for sigil_probe.

# Run `mix credo --strict`. ExSlop is registered as a *plugin* (per its
# README) — registering it under checks.enabled makes Credo ignore it as an
# "undefined check", so it must live in `plugins:`. It contributes ~31 checks
# that flag AI-generated Elixir slop (blanket rescue, narrator docs, obvious
# comments, anti-idiomatic Enum usage, try/rescue around non-raising calls,
# N+1 queries, …) on top of Credo's strict defaults.
